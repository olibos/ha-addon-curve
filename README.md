Import [Curve](https://curve.com/en-gb/) transactions effortlessly into Firefly III for streamlined finance.

## About

Curve's "One card to rule them all" service consolidates multiple credit and debit cards into a single Curve Mastercard, managed through a centralized app. Users can streamline their wallet, choosing which underlying card to charge for payments, and benefit from features like expense tracking and rewards. This service enhances convenience, simplifies financial management, and offers a more flexible and streamlined payment experience for users.

This add-on being developed facilitates the integration of Curve's transaction email notifications with Firefly III, a notable personal finance management tool. This project offers users the ability to effortlessly import and categorize their Curve card transactions into Firefly III, enhancing the efficiency of expense tracking. The integration ensures a seamless connection between the transaction notifications received from Curve and the comprehensive financial management capabilities of Firefly III, ultimately contributing to a more streamlined and integrated approach to personal finance within a home environment.
